# NeuViT: Neuromorphic Vision Transformer

A spike-driven vision transformer for real-time, energy-efficient object detection on UAV platforms.

## Highlights

- **88.8% energy reduction** compared to Swin Transformer
- **22.1 FPS at 3.98W** on VisDrone2019 (1500×2000 resolution)
- Single-step stateless spiking neurons eliminate temporal dependencies
- MAC-free spike-coincidence attention reduces complexity from O(N²D) to O(ND)
- Validated across 45nm, 16nm, and 7nm technology nodes
